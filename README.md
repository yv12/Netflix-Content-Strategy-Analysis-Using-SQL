# Netflix-Data-ELT and Analysis

ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform. It's a process used to handle data in a way that makes it easier to analyze and use. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:

Extract: This step involves pulling data from various sources like databases, spreadsheets, or even websites.

Load: Once you have the data, you move it to a central storage area, like a data warehouse.

Transform: Finally, you clean, organize, and prepare the data so it's ready for analysis.
